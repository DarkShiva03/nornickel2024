# nornickel2024
Nornickel's Hackathon: Intellectual Horizons 2024.
Tasks:

1. Time Flotation Machine
In this task, we aim to optimize ore extraction from pulp by finding the most efficient ranges under given constraints. Participants will have to consider various features, their boundaries, and the width of the ranges. Using algorithms and models, teams will be able to improve the efficiency of the enrichment process, which will lead to significant economic and environmental benefits.

2. Dirty Deeds
Dirty camera lenses can seriously affect the performance of computer vision algorithms. In this task, it is necessary to develop a method for determining the degree of frame contamination to ensure reliable operation of cameras in production, as well as in robot couriers and autonomous vehicles. Solving this problem will help improve the accuracy and efficiency of various systems that depend on visual data.

3. Multimodal RAG Models
The task is to create an efficient pipeline for automatic document search and indexing using multimodal RAG and the ColPali model. Participants will have to develop a system that can process various data formats, providing fast and accurate indexing. This solution will significantly simplify access to information and increase the productivity of working with documents in various fields.
